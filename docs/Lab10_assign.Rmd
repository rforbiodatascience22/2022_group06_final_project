#**Preliminary outline for project:** 

* Recreation of visualizations illustrated in article.

* Remove non-assayable datapoints.

* covariation(?) on PBL and PC.

* Daily fat intake vs smoking as contributor to PC (covarianse/residual analysis)

* Split DFT, Smoking History and BMI off, examine and join back in.

* PC, BMI and age in relation to each other. (maybe stratify on smoking habits).

* Find clear description of TNM stage and incorporate in manipulaitons? (What does TNM, AJCC and mtDNA signify? - correlations?)

* Categorize participants based on BMI - maybe also on other factors?
