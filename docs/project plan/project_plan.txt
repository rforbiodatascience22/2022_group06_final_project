Questions for TA:
Q1) Any functions we really do need to show we can master?
  a) The core tidyverse functions (such as dplyr)
  b) Show that we master the data science cycle
Q2) Can we do other kind of split than we suggested in the handed-in outline?
  a) yes
Q3) When to use '::' and when not to?
  a) Dont use in the analysis, only needed to ensure no masking of functions
Q4) We have a problem with loading data, how much can we add to our load script?
  a) Fixing the data here is ok, but should be done on column name, not position
Q5) How can we guard against duplets in 02_clean.R?
  a) current implement is good, maybe use a logfile

Q6) How important is it that we don't use base R functions? (using ncol over creating a function with purrr)


Presentation outline 
-Introduction data    DONE
-Cleaning             DONE
-What has been done in article?
  -With our plots     PLOT DONE, some table recreations missing
-Examine PCA,
  -Because of 
  -Conclusion


Project flow:
1) 
while project == "not_finished":
  case_when(cup == "empty" ~ get_coffee())
2) Load data, one variable for each sheet
3) Are the data tidy?
4) Clean data (How many failed PCR, should they all be removed?)
  a) Any other outliers? Maybe check this with boxplot for each variable
5) Augment data (split and join)
  a) Case when (BMI into classifiers)
  b) Split in case of Family History?
  c) Split in case of DFT, smoking history and BMI 
  d) Do some fancy nesting stuff perhaps? Not really sure how that works though
  e) Can we find other stuff to add/alter?
6) Do PCA
7) Logistic Regression
8) Data visualization

To do:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1) Check we follow the project flow
2) Make sure we use the same naming conventions
3) Is the coding style correct across the board (newline, include "=" where possible)
4) Data visualitation with "slice" function
5) Use geom_violin?
9) Add color to titles, see Lab 3 Task IX
- 6) Insert subtitles?
- 9) Add color to titles, see Lab 3 Task IX
10) Make sure we fully understand the summarise function
11) *Go through code*, did we do anything multiple times? Make a function
12) Use "separate" function for TMN? (function from Lab 5, Q20)
15) Create a flowchart of our data handlig? To visualize what we did


Change "controls" to "control" and "pca_cases" to "pca_case"
Align pca and Prostate cancer.
Fix 11_, should it be included? - no, we keep it for show, but there is no
  relevant info to be found.
violin plots (article visualization) - Eskild
factor classes in 09, like in 03. - Esben


Slides
  Include 09-slide
  Adjust conclusion slide.
  Code-flowchart
  More color, its bland.
=======
1) Data visualitation with "slice" function
2) Insert subtitles?
3) Make functions where needed
4) Factor 09 as in 03 - Esben
5) Make manuscript for oral exam
6) Include 09 in slides
7) Conclusion slide is not done
