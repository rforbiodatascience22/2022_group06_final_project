Questions for TA:
Q1) Any functions we really do need to show we can master?
  a) The core tidyverse functions (such as dplyr)
  b) Show that we master the data science cycle
Q2) Can we do other kind of split than we suggested in the handed-in outline?
  a) yes
Q3) When to use '::' and when not to?
  a) Dont use in the analysis, only needed to ensure no masking of functions
Q4) We have a problem with loading data, how much can we add to our load script?
  a) Fixing the data here is ok, but should be done on column name, not position
Q5) How can we guard against duplets in 02_clean.R?
  a) current implement is good, maybe use a logfile

Q6) How important is it that we don't use base R functions? (using ncol over creating a function with purrr)

Project flow:
1) 
while project == "not_finished":
  case_when(cup == "empty" ~ get_coffee())
2) Load data, one variable for each sheet
3) Are the data tidy?
4) Clean data (How many failed PCR, should they all be removed?)
  a) Any other outliers? Maybe check this with boxplot for each variable
5) Augment data (split and join)
  a) Case when (BMI into classifiers)
  b) Split in case of Family History?
  c) Split in case of DFT, smoking history and BMI 
  d) Do some fancy nesting stuff perhaps? Not really sure how that works though
  e) Can we find other stuff to add/alter?
6) Do PCA
7) Logistic Regression
8) Data visualization
